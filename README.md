# Game design goals

- Boost is theoretically always present
- Boost is limited by amount of adrenaline [ball and stick bar maybe? https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epinephrine#/media/File:Epinephrine_ball-and-stick_model.png]
- Adrenaline is filled up by takedowns
- Adrenaline is removed on crashes
- If adrenaline is used up insane driving will lead to blackouts [heartbeet sound to show end]
- If speed is too high for too long the boat will flip / crash [beeping sound to show boat instability]

- No open world
- Track part re-use [= level with multiple tracks]
  - Kind of like in burnout 3, but make it feel like OR2


# Race modes

- Normal mode
  - Standard Race
  - Preview events
    - Faster boats than currently available
    - Burning lap with unlimited attempts [flying start and then repeat rounds]
  - Knock Out Grand-Prix [3 attempts total]
    - at the end of each level
    - ending with a long lap around all tracks?
  - River-Rage
    - Cause harm to others
    - Crash as many boats as possible
  - Select-a-track?
    - Players can choose easy or hard route at intersections
    - very strict timelimit for each checkpoint
    - Must complete all routes in the end?
    - FIXME: Lakes which are not reachable from the other parts of the world should be marked as special in the map selection or even be reserved for certain events?
- Some kind of Crazy X [Crazy Taxi] mode:
  - Pop-Balloons
  - Go a full lap on high speed
  - Make it through a wall of oncoming traffic [Crazy Taxi football minigame]
  - Shoot your wreck as far as possible or through rings [Flatout style]
  - Bring *something* from A to B [crazy-taxi minigame]
  - Do math tasks and simon says [Outrun 2 girlfriend mode]
  - Stay behind another boat
  - Slalom [possibly like the first Driver parking garage mission?]
  - Pull a wakeboarder through waves
  - Stay between 2 (or more?) other boats and do not crash [no checkpoints]
  - Drive a stunt formation with others where checkpoints with min/max deadline are very close to oncoming / crossing high speed boats
    - [Possibly add fighter jets / planes too for effect]
  - Some bowling mode with a long boat to force drifting
  - Rampage (Hit a bungee jumper jumping from a bridge, nail down fishers, ...)

# Levels

The game is supposed to have a handful of levels with a couple of tracks each.
A lot of the following ideas will probably be merged into larger levels.

Real world places do not have to exist / can be mixed with others.
This is more about creating an authentic climate / world.

## Ice/Antarctica or something

- Pack ice
- Collapsing cliffs

## Canyon

- Huge bridge
- Dam with small lake
- Just a small lake

## British Canal

- Small cities
- Green mountains

## Tropical beach

- Palms
- Beaches
- Clear water
- Cruise ship in water?
- Dolphins?
- Planes landing near water maybe?

## Indonesia (maybe philipines?)

- Rice fields
- Temples
- Cliffs

## Jungle [maybe parts of indonesia?]

- Trees on sides
- Dead trees or rocks in center of water as obstacles

## Miami

- Races along beaches
- Detour through city

## Some industrial thing

- Cranes on land
- Freightships on canal towards harbour

## Hometown lake

- Lake surrounded by green mountains
- Fisherboats and smaller piers near edges

## Oriental

- Waterparks and rollercoasters nearby [maybe one going over a canal?]

## Soundtrack

Here is a collection of songs which might be acceptable.
Need to figure out licensing / copyrights and such.

It should mostly be some kind of electronic for short menu sequences.
For the race part focus should be on punk, rock and metal.

Songs will probably be downloaded from soundcloud or other streaming providers.
